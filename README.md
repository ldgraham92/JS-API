# JavaScript AJAX / API Assignment

# Introduction
View the repository at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis and choose an API to work with. Look for one with no Auth required. If “CORS Policy Errors” are occuring, try HTTP instead of HTTPS, or a different API. You might have to try a few out in Postman and/or your JavaScript before it comes through for you.  

Build a small JavaScript application to make calls to this API and display the returned data in the browser. Your solution should have the following functionality.

# Requirements
Include screenshots in your repo of your API call working in Postman  
Get a response from an API  
Convert a JSON object into a JavaScript object or array for the returned data  
Render the returned data using DOM  

# Challenges
Make it look nice with some CSS!  
Add a form to customize the request (use an API that accepts POST or GET parameters)
